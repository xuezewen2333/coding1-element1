the cube world

This project explores the visual boundaries of computerized two-dimensional and three-dimensional space through the deconstruction, reorganization, and self-rotation changes of the cube. I try to express the three physical forms of water - solid, gas and liquid - through the ever-changing dispersion effect of the cube, and perceptual visualization is the subject I want to explore, 'Perception is inseparable from our senses and it is how we make sense of the world.'[1]

The whole project animation runs in a loop, just like the three physical states of the water element are constantly changing, with a constant cycle of energy...
